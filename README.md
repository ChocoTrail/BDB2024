## Files:

*ideas.qmd*
A document with a list of ideas for the project

*animate.R*
R script that can read in the Big Data Bowl Data, choose a play, and then animate it in a very basic way

### Repo Notes:

In order for the code to work, you should have a folder called `Data` that contains all the raw Big Data Bowl csv's from the Kaggle website. They are not tracked and shouldn't be tracked on this repository for space restrictions.
